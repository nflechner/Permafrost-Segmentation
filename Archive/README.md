This directory is for future reference only, and will likely be deleted once the final version is done. It contains scripts that were generated while experimenting and developing the final models being used now. Particularily, it contains various approaches of generating pseudomasks:

- finetuning a VGG (using only RGB)
- custom models (allowing for depth as additional channel)
- training the models as classification (palsa/no palsa) vs regression (% estimated palsa) models
