This project used data by Lantmateriet. Specifically, we used the RGB channels from their [ortophotos](https://www.lantmateriet.se/sv/geodata/vara-produkter/produktlista/ortofoto-nedladdning/), as well as their [Digital Elevation Model (DEM)](https://www.lantmateriet.se/sv/geodata/vara-produkter/produktlista/markhojdmodell-nedladdning/). 

The ortophotos have a resolution of 0,5m per pixel, and a spatial extent of 5km x 5km. The height model has a resolution of 1m per pixel and a spatial extent of 2.5km x 2.5km. As such, the height model was upsampled to match the ortophoto resolution. A hillshade representation was also derived using QGIS's [hillshade algorithm](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/rasterterrainanalysis.html#hillshade). This was done for experimentation of which data combinations (R,G,B,DEM,hillshade) would produce the best results in generating the pseudomasks. 

In an earlier analysis of palsas, [Backe et al](https://www.lansstyrelsen.se/norrbotten/om-oss/vara-tjanster/publikationer/2014/kartering-av-sveriges-palsmyrar.html) analysed 100x100m areas and estimated the percentage of palsa contained in them. During testing with various image sizes (100m, 200m, 500m), we found that the CNN perfomed best when trained on 200m images. Therefore, we crop the data into 200x200m squares, which align with 4 adjacent squares from Backe's research. In this way, the estimated % of palsa contained in the resulting image can be derived from the 4 images within it. All 200x200 images are stored as TIF files to allow for the preservation of metadata.
